Aaronson,4,"Aaronson grew up in the United States, though he spent a year in Asia when his father—a science writer turned public-relations executive—was posted to Hong Kong.[2] He enrolled in a school there that permitted him to skip ahead several years in math, but upon returning to the US, he found his education restrictive, getting bad grades and having run-ins with teachers. He enrolled in The Clarkson School, a gifted education program run by Clarkson University, which enabled Aaronson to apply for colleges while only in his freshman year of high school.[2] He was accepted into Cornell University, where he obtained his BSc in computer science in 2000,[3] and where he resided at the Telluride House.[4] He then attended the University of California, Berkeley, for his PhD, which he got in 2004 under the supervision of Umesh Vazirani.[5] Aaronson had shown ability in mathematics from an early age, teaching himself calculus at the age of 11, provoked by symbols in a babysitter's textbook. He discovered computer programming at age 11, and felt he lagged behind peers, who had already been coding for years. In part due to Aaronson getting into advanced mathematics before getting into computer programming, he felt drawn to theoretical computing, particularly computational complexity theory. At Cornell, he became interested in quantum computing and devoted himself to computational complexity and quantum computing.[2]"

He began his employment at MIT that year,[8] and retired from the faculty of the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science during the 1999–2000 school year.[9] He became emeritus in the  department in 2000.[10] Among the doctoral students that Hewitt supervised during his time at MIT are Gul Agha, Henry Baker, William Clinger, Irene Greif,  and Akinori Yonezawa.[11] From September 1989 to August 1990, Hewitt was the IBM Chair Visiting Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Keio University in Japan.[12] He has also been a Visiting Professor at Stanford University."
Hightower,0,"Hightower grew up in Long Beach, California, then moved to Atlanta, Georgia with his mother as he was beginning high school. After high school he enrolled at Clayton State University, but found the technology courses to be lacking and didn't continue. He then began courses to earn his CompTIA A+ information technology (IT) certification.[2]"
Hinton,9,"Hinton was educated at King's College, Cambridge. After repeatedly changing his degree between different subjects like natural sciences, history of art, and philosophy, he eventually graduated in 1970 with a bachelor of arts in experimental psychology.[11] He continued his study at the University of Edinburgh where he was awarded a PhD in artificial intelligence in 1978 for research supervised by Christopher Longuet-Higgins.[2][33]"
Ho,5,Ho completed her undergraduate education at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1984.  She received a Ph.D. in computer science from State University of New York at Buffalo in 1992.[1]
Hoare,7,"Tony Hoare was born in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to British parents; his father was a colonial civil servant and his mother was the daughter of a tea planter. Hoare was educated in England at the Dragon School in Oxford and the King's School in Canterbury.[13] He then studied Classics and Philosophy (""Greats"") at Merton College, Oxford.[14] On graduating in 1956 he did 18 months National Service in the Royal Navy,[14] where he learned Russian.[15] He returned to the University of Oxford in 1958 to study for a postgraduate certificate in statistics,[14] and it was here that he began computer programming, having been taught Autocode on the Ferranti Mercury by Leslie Fox.[16] He then went to Moscow State University as a British Council exchange student,[14] where he studied machine translation under Andrey Kolmogorov.[15]"
Holberton,4,"Holberton was born Frances Elizabeth Snyder in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1917. Her father was John Amos Snyder (1884–1963), her mother was Frances J. Morrow (1892–1981), and she was the third child in a family of eight children. Holberton studied journalism, because its curriculum let her travel far afield.[2] Journalism was also one of the few fields open to women as a career in the 1940s.[3] On her first day of classes at the University of Pennsylvania, her math professor asked her if she wouldn't be better off at home raising children.[3]"
Hopcroft,8,"He received his bachelor's degree from Seattle University in 1961.[6] He received his master's degree and Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1962 and 1964, respectively. He worked for three years at Princeton University and since then has been at Cornell University. Hopcroft is the grandson of Jacob Nist, founder of the Seattle-Tacoma Box Company.[7]"
Hopper,9,"Grace Brewster Murray was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church.[8] Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.[8]: 2–3 Grace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock).[9] For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Grace was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (because her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930. In 1930, Grace Murray married New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906–1976); they divorced in 1945.[10][11] She did not marry again and retained his surname. In 1934, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale[12] under the direction of Øystein Ore.[10][13] Her dissertation, ""New Types of Irreducibility Criteria"",[14] was published that same year.[15] She began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.[16]"
Huffman,1,"Huffman earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Ohio State University in 1944. Then, he served two years as an officer in the United States Navy. He returned to Ohio State to earn his master's degree in electrical engineering in 1949. In 1953, he earned his Doctor of Science in electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with the thesis The Synthesis of Sequential Switching Circuits, advised by Samuel H. Caldwell.[1][2][4]"
Hui,1,"Hui was born in Hong Kong in 1953. In 1966, he immigrated to Canada with his entire family.[3] In 1973, Hui entered the University of Alberta. In his second year he took a course on probability and statistics in which students were expected to learn the programming language APL with little or no formal instruction. He used all the time he could muster on a heavily burdened computer, and benefited from the APL\360 User's Manual (the book APL Language was not published until March 1975). Because the manual was written by Adin Falkoff and Kenneth E. Iverson, Hui thought it reasonable to say he learned APL from Falkoff and Iverson. As a summer student in 1975 and 1976, Hui worked at I. P. Sharp Associates (IPSA) in Calgary, on workspaces for statistical and probability calculations. The major attraction of the job was the unrestricted computer time with access to APL. After receiving a BSc degree with first class honors in computer science in 1977, Hui worked for two years as a full-time programmer and analyst in the new Edmonton office of IPSA, where his main duty was to support clients in their use of APL time-sharing. He attended the APL79 conference in Rochester, New York, where Iverson gave two papers: ""The Role of Operators in APL"" and ""The Derivative Operator"". On the way, Hui stopped at IPSA in Toronto and obtained a copy of ""Operators and Functions"" [IBM Research Report No. 7091, 1978]. He has been studying that paper and its successors ever since.[citation needed] In September 1979, Hui entered the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, and received his MSc in May 1981 with a thesis on ""The complexity of some decompositions in matrix algebra.""[4] After completing his master's degree, Hui worked from 1981 to 1985 as an APL systems analyst and programmer for the Alberta Energy Company in Edmonton. In February 1982 Hui purchased A Source Book in APL (1981), in which the most memorable papers were ""The Design of APL"" (1973), ""The Evolution of APL"" (1978), and ""Notation as a Tool of Thought"" (1980). Hui's work was described at the APL85 conference in a paper, ""DESIGN: A Financial Modelling System"", written jointly with his supervisor, Fred Appleyard. The basic objects in the system were in ""Direct Definition"" (Iverson, 1976, 1980), and Falkoff and Iverson's The Design of APL was cited. Hui left Alberta Energy shortly after being promoted to a non-APL and non-programming position, and was out of work, and had no access to computers, from September 1985 to April 1986. This gave him plenty of time for intense study of Iverson's Rationalized APL (1983) and A Dictionary of the APL Language, as it was then named. Hui and his wife Stella had two children.  He died on October 16, 2021 from cancer.[5]"
Hutchins,0,"Hutchins received her B.A. from the University of California,[1] San Diego, in 1967. During her undergraduate studies, Hutchins majored in physics and minored in linguistics. In 1970, she received her Ph.D. in computer science, also from the University of California, San Diego.[2]"
Ingalls,5,"Ingalls received his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in physics from Harvard University, and his Master of Science (M.S.) in electrical engineering from Stanford University. While working toward a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) at Stanford, he started a company to sell a software measurement invention that he perfected, and never returned to academia."
Irwin,3,"Mary Jane Irwin received her B.S. in Mathematics from Memphis State University in 1971, and her M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois in 1975 and 1977, respectively.  Her dissertation research on the topic of computer arithmetic was supervised by Dr. James Robertson."
Iverson,4,"Iverson began school on 1 April 1926 in a one-room school,[4] initially in Grade 1, promoted to Grade 2 after 3 months and to Grade 4 by the end of June 1927.
He left school after Grade 9 because it was the depths of the Great Depression and there was work to do on the family farm, and because he thought further schooling only led to becoming a schoolteacher and he had no desire to become one.  At age 17, while still out of school, he enrolled in a correspondence course on radios with De Forest Training in Chicago, and learned calculus by self-study from a textbook.[4][6]
During World War II, while serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force, he took correspondence courses toward a high school diploma. After the war, Iverson enrolled in Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, taking advantage of government support for ex-servicemen and under threat from an Air Force buddy who said he would ""beat his brains out if he did not grasp the opportunity"".[4] He graduated in 1950 as the top student with a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics.[3] Continuing his education at Harvard University, he began in the Department of Mathematics and received a Master's degree in 1951.  He then switched to the Department of Engineering and Applied Physics, working with Howard Aiken and Wassily Leontief. Kenneth Iverson has recalled graduate study under Aiken as ""like an apprenticeship"" in which the student ""learned the tools of the scholarship trade"". Every topic was ""used more as a focus for the development of skills such as clarity of thought and expression than as an end in itself"". Once admitted to the program, a graduate student underwent a rite of ""adoption into the fold"". He was given a desk (or a share of a desk) among a group of other graduate students, the permanent staff, or visiting scholars, ""most of whom were engaged in some aspect of the design and building of computers"". A student was thus ""made to feel part of a scholarly enterprise"" and was provided, ""often for the first time, with easy and intimate access to others more experienced in his chosen field"". When interviewing Aiken, I had asked him whether Tropp and I might see his lecture notes; Aiken replied that he had always destroyed his lecture notes at the end of each year, so that he would not be tempted to repeat his lectures. Howard Aiken had developed the Harvard Mark I, one of the first large-scale digital computers, while Wassily Leontief was an economist who was developing the input–output model of economic analysis, work for which he would later receive the Nobel prize. Leontief's model required large matrices and Iverson worked on programs that could evaluate these matrices on the Harvard Mark IV computer. Iverson received a Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1954 with a dissertation based on this work.[9][10] At Harvard, Iverson met Eoin Whitney, a 2-time Putnam Fellow and fellow graduate student from Alberta.[11][12]  This had future ramifications."

Knuth,13,"Knuth received a scholarship in physics to the Case Institute of Technology (now part of Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio, enrolling in 1956.[10] He also joined the Beta Nu Chapter of the Theta Chi fraternity. While studying physics at Case, Knuth was introduced to the IBM 650, an early commercial computer. After reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he believed he could do it better.[11] In 1958, Knuth created a program to help his school's basketball team win their games.[12] He assigned ""values"" to players in order to gauge their probability of scoring points, a novel approach that Newsweek and CBS Evening News later reported on.[11] Knuth was one of the founding editors of the Case Institute's Engineering and Science Review, which won a national award as best technical magazine in 1959.[13][14] He then switched from physics to mathematics, and received two degrees from Case in 1960:[10] his bachelor of science, and simultaneously a master of science by a special award of the faculty, who considered his work exceptionally outstanding.[4][11] In 1963, with mathematician Marshall Hall as his adviser,[2] he earned a PhD in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology for a thesis entitled Finite Semifields and Projective Planes.[15]"

Korn,0,"David Korn received his undergraduate degree in mathematics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1965 and his Ph.D. in applied mathematics from NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1969. After working on computer simulations of transsonic airfoils and developing the Korn airfoil,[2] he switched fields to computer science and became a member of technical staff at Bell Laboratories in 1976. He developed Korn shell in response to problems he and his colleagues had with the most commonly used shells at the time, Bourne shell and C shell. The Korn shell pioneered the practice of consultative user interface design, with input from Unix shell users, and from mathematical and cognitive psychologists.[citation needed] The user interface, which included a choice of editing styles (the choices included styles based on vi and on two variants of Emacs) was incorporated into, or copied by, most subsequent Unix shells. The Korn shell is backward-compatible with Bourne shell, but takes a lot of ideas from C shell, such as history viewing and vi-like command line editing."

Lenat,1,"Lenat was born in Philadelphia, United States, on September 13, 1950.[14] When he was 5, the family moved to Wilmington, Delaware, where his father, Nathan Lenat, owned a bottling plant.[14]  His father died when he was 13 and the family then returned to Pennsylvania, where he attended Cheltenham High School.[14]  His after-school job was cleaning rat cages and goose pens at Beaver College which motivated him to learn programming as a better occupation.[14] He attended the University of Pennsylvania, supporting himself by programming, including the design and development of a natural language interface for a United States Navy online operations manual.  He graduated with bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Physics, and a master's degree in Applied Mathematics, all in 1972.[14] For his senior thesis, advised in part by Dennis Gabor, was to bounce acoustic waves in the 40 mHz range off real-world objects, record their interference patterns on a 2-meter square plot, photo-reduce those to a 10-mm square film image, shine a laser through the film, and thus project the three-dimensional imaged object—i.e., the first known acoustic hologram.[citation needed] To settle an argument with Dr. Gabor, Lenat computer-generated a five-dimensional hologram, by photo-reducing computer printout of the interference pattern of a globe rotating and expanding over time, reducing the large two-dimensional paper printout to a moderately large 5-cm square film surface through which a conventional laser beam was then able to project a three-dimensional image, which changed in two independent ways (rotating and changing in size) as the film was moved up-down or left-right.[citation needed] Lenat was a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford University, where his published research included automatic program synthesis from input/output pairs and from natural language clarification dialogues.[15]"
LeCun,3,He received a Diplôme d'Ingénieur from the ESIEE Paris in 1983 and a PhD in Computer Science from Université Pierre et Marie Curie (today Sorbonne University) in 1987 during which he proposed an early form of the back-propagation learning algorithm for neural networks.[14]

He contributed to the Apache HTTP Server and he added the LIMIT clause to the mSQL DBMS. A variant of this LIMIT clause had already been around for a decade in mainframe relational database management systems (like Oracle Rdb running on VMS, formerly from Digital Equipment Corporation), but apparently it had not yet been picked up by the emerging PC-based databases. It was later adapted by several other SQL-compatible DBMS.[4][5] He released the first version of PHP in 1995.[6]"
Levchin,0,"Born in Kyiv, Ukrainian SSR to a Ukrainian-Jewish family, Levchin moved to the United States and settled in Chicago in 1991.[3][4][5] In an interview with Emily Chang of Bloomberg, Levchin discussed his overcoming adversity as a child. He had respiratory problems and doctors doubted his chance of living. With guidance from his grandmother and his parents he took up the clarinet to expand his lung capacity.[6] He attended Mather High School, and then the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he earned a bachelor's degree in computer science in 1997."
Liedtke,0,"In the mid-1970s Liedtke studied for a diploma degree in mathematics at the Bielefeld University. His thesis project was to build a compiler for the programming language ELAN, which had been launched for teaching programming in German schools.[citation needed] The compiler was written in ELAN."

Lovelace,0,"From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,[22] and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life.[38] Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King,[a] and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. In the 1840s, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended her ""much help in her mathematical studies"" including study of advanced calculus topics including the ""numbers of Bernoulli"" (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine).[39] In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill in mathematics might lead her to become ""an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence"".[40] Lovelace often questioned basic assumptions through integrating poetry and science. Whilst studying differential calculus, she wrote to De Morgan: I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in one shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar.[41] Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring ""the unseen worlds around us"".[42]"

His father came from Cromane, a small fishing village in County Kerry, Ireland.[5] His mother died in 1957.[6] Both parents were active members of the Communist Party during the 1930s, and they encouraged learning and critical thinking. Before he attended high school, he got interested in science by reading a translation of a Russian popular science book for children, called 100,000 Whys.[7]  John was fluent in the Russian language and made friends with Russian scientists during multiple trips to the Soviet Union but he distanced himself after making visits to the Soviet Bloc which led to him becoming a conservative Republican.[8] McCarthy graduated from Belmont High School two years early.[9] McCarthy was accepted into Caltech in 1944. McCarthy showed an early aptitude for mathematics; during his teens he taught himself college mathematics by studying the textbooks used at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech). As a result, he was able to skip the first two years of mathematics at Caltech.[10]
McCarthy was suspended from Caltech for failure to attend physical education courses.[11] He then served in the US Army and was readmitted, receiving a BS in mathematics in 1948.[12] It was at Caltech that he attended a lecture by John von Neumann that inspired his future endeavors.

Perlman,11,"As an undergraduate at MIT Perlman learned programming for a physics class. She was given her first paid job in 1971 as part-time programmer for the LOGO Lab at the (then) MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, programming system software such as debuggers. [14] Working under the supervision of Seymour Papert, she developed a child-friendly version of the educational robotics language LOGO, called TORTIS (""Toddler's Own Recursive Turtle Interpreter System""). During research performed in 1974–76, young children—the youngest aged 3½ years, programmed a LOGO educational robot called a Turtle. Perlman has been described as a pioneer of teaching young children computer programming.[15] Afterwards, she was inspired to make a new programming language that would teach much younger children similar to Logo, but using special ""keyboards"" and input devices. This project was abandoned because ""being the only woman around, I wanted to be taken seriously as a 'scientist' and was a little embarrassed that my project involved cute little kids"". MIT media project later tracked her down and told her that she started a new field called tangible user interface from the leftovers of her abandoned project. [16]
As a math grad at MIT she needed to find an adviser for her thesis, and joined the MIT group at BBN Technologies. There she first got involved with designing network protocols.[17] Perlman obtained a B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT in 1988.[18]  She earned her PhD in computer science from MIT in 1988; her doctoral thesis on routing in environments where malicious network failures are present serves as the basis for much of the work that now exists in this area. [2] When studying at MIT in the late 60s she was one among the 50 or so women students, in a class of about 1,000 students. To begin with MIT only had one women’s dorm, limiting the number of women students that could study. When the men’s dorms at MIT became coed Perlman moved out of the women’s dorm into a mixed dorm, where she became the ""resident female"". She later said that she was so used to the gender imbalance, that it became normal. Only when she saw other women students among a crowd of men she noticed that ""it kind of looked weird"".[19]"

Simon attended Milwaukee Public Schools, where he developed an interest in science and established himself as an atheist. While attending middle school, Simon wrote a letter to ""the editor of the Milwaukee Journal defending the civil liberties of atheists"".[17] Unlike most children, Simon's family introduced him to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically; his mother's younger brother, Harold Merkel (1892–1922), who studied economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison under John R. Commons, became one of his earliest influences. Through Harold's books on economics and psychology, Simon discovered social science. Among his earliest influences, Simon cited Norman Angell for his book The Great Illusion and Henry George for his book Progress and Poverty. While attending high school, Simon joined the debate team, where he argued ""from conviction, rather than cussedness"" in favor of George's single tax.[18] In 1933, Simon entered the University of Chicago, and, following his early influences, decided to study social science and mathematics. Simon was interested in studying biology but chose not to pursue the field because of his ""color-blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory"".[19] At an early age, Simon learned he was color blind and discovered the external world is not the same as the perceived world. While in college, Simon focused on political science and economics. Simon's most important mentor was Henry Schultz, an econometrician and mathematical economist.[1] Simon received both his B.A. (1936) and his Ph.D. (1943) in political science from the University of Chicago, where he studied under Harold Lasswell, Nicolas Rashevsky, Rudolf Carnap, Henry Schultz, and Charles Edward Merriam.[20] After enrolling in a course on ""Measuring Municipal Governments,"" Simon became a research assistant for Clarence Ridley, and the two co-authored Measuring Municipal Activities: A Survey of Suggested Criteria for Appraising Administration in 1938.[21] Simon's studies led him to the field of organizational decision-making, which became the subject of his doctoral dissertation."

Winograd,1,"Winograd grew up in Colorado and graduated from Colorado College in 1966. He wrote SHRDLU as a PhD thesis at MIT in the years from 1968–70. In making the program Winograd was concerned with the problem of providing a computer with sufficient ""understanding"" to be able to use natural language. Winograd built a blocks world, restricting the program's intellectual world to a simulated ""world of toy blocks"". The program could accept commands such as, ""Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box"" and carry out the requested action using a simulated block-moving  arm. The program could also respond verbally, for example, ""I do not know which block you mean."" The SHRDLU program can be viewed historically as one of the classic examples of how difficult it is for a programmer to build up a computer's semantic memory by hand and how limited or ""brittle"" such programs are.[4]"
Wiseman,0,"Born in Cowlinge near Newmarket, Suffolk, Wiseman joined the Pye electronics company in Cambridge as an apprentice in 1950. 1954–1957 he studied for a BSc (Eng) degree in electrical engineering at Queen Mary College, University of London.
